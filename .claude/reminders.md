## Race Results Filtering Enhancement
Add filter options for viewing race results by different criteria:
- Age category (Junior, Junior A, Junior B, U24, Premier, Senior A, Senior B, Senior C, Senior D, BCP, ACP)
- Stage (Heat, Semi-Final, Final, etc.)
- Division (if applicable)
- Boat size (Standard, Small)
- Distance (200m, 500m, 1000m, 2000m)
- Gender group (Mixed, Women, Open)
- Team name (search by full or partial name)
- Country

This would allow users to narrow down race results more effectively instead of scrolling through all results.
